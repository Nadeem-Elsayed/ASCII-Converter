The methods in this project allow conversion from ASCII codes to Regular characters

They also allow for the conversion of regular characters to ASCII codes

You can convert an entire string of characters and you will get all the ASCII codes back.

I made this because ASCII codes are confusing, and the first 31 literally don't appear properly in conversions.

Ex: new line characters, end of line, null, start of heading.
